# Time-Based Blind SQL Injection in ``login.php``

|             | Details |

| **Vulnerability Type** | SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind) |
| **Affected File** | `login.php` â†’ calls ``User::AuthenticateUser()`` in ``include/user.php`` |

### Summary
-  A time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the login.php page of the ILUMS project. The ``user_email`` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without sanitization or parameter binding.
-  This flaw allows attackers to perform time-based inference attacks to extract database content, including usernames and password hashes, ultimately leading to full compromise of authentication credentials.

**Evidence:** *sqlmap output*

### Vulnerable Code
```php
// include/user.php
$mydb->setQuery("SELECT * FROM `useraccounts` 
                 WHERE `ACCOUNT_USERNAME`='" . $email . "' 
                 and `ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`='" . $h_upass ."' LIMIT 1");

```
-  The ``$email`` variable (from ``user_email`` POST parameter) is directly embedded into the SQL query.
-  No prepared statements or escaping are used.
-  This allows attackers to inject crafted SQL payloads.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following payload was generated and tested with sqlmap against the ``user_email`` parameter in ``login.php``.

### 1. Request in Burp
-    A normal login attempt was intercepted with Burp Suite.
-    The raw request was saved into a file sqlfile for sqlmap testing.

### 2. ``sqlmap`` dump
-   Run sqlmap using the Burp request file
-   sqlmap confirmed the injection point.

## Result:
-  The server delayed its response by 5 seconds, confirming successful time-based injection.
-  Sqlmap was able to enumerate the database ``(ilmsdb)`` and dump the useraccounts table.
